    <h1>Lung Transplant Decision Aid</h1>
    <p>
      A human-computer interaction capstone project focused on designing a
      clinical decision support tool for patients with severe COPD considering
      lung transplantation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-content">

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Patients with severe COPD often face a difficult choice: pursue lung
      transplantation or continue medical management. While survival rates
      can be similar across treatments, the tradeoffs in risk, quality of life,
      and complications are substantial.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our client, a practicing pulmonologist and researcher at UPMC, observed
      that many patients misunderstood the risks, overestimated benefits,
      or felt overwhelmed during evaluation week. Many patients had low health
      literacy, limited computer experience, and high cognitive load.
    </p>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
      Design a web-based decision aid that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Clarifies that patients have a meaningful choice</li>
      <li>Communicates risks and tradeoffs in digestible ways</li>
      <li>Helps patients reflect on personal values</li>
      <li>Improves comprehension before formal evaluation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      I served as Technical Lead. I helped structure the decision framework,
      translate clinical data into interpretable representations, and design
      interactive components that balanced usability with statistical clarity.
    </p>

    <h2>Research & Design Process</h2>

    <h3>User Research</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stakeholder interviews (pulmonologists, surgeons, coordinators, social workers)</li>
      <li>Observation of patient counseling sessions</li>
      <li>Client data analysis (COBALT dataset, DECIDE survey, focus group)</li>
      <li>Review of decision science literature and existing decision aids</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We identified a core challenge: patients often defaulted toward transplant
      without fully understanding complications, timelines, or long-term tradeoffs.
    </p>

    <h3>Iterative Prototyping</h3>
    <p>
      We developed low-, medium-, and high-fidelity prototypes, testing navigation
      structure, risk visualization, and values-elicitation quizzes.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Side-by-side comparison of transplant vs. medical management</li>
      <li>Interactive values quizzes</li>
      <li>Risk visualization using human figures rather than abstract dots</li>
      <li>Progress-based guided navigation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Findings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Patients preferred patient video narratives over physician explanations.</li>
      <li>Minimal information per screen improved comprehension.</li>
      <li>Interactive value reflection increased engagement.</li>
      <li>Risk statistics required careful wording and contextualization.</li>
      <li>Navigation structure significantly impacted understanding.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical & Conceptual Contributions</h2>
    <p>
      This project sits at the intersection of behavioral science and
      decision support systems. It required translating probabilistic
      medical outcomes into formats that were accurate, interpretable,
      and usable under real cognitive constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      It reflects broader themes in my work: how people interpret
      uncertain information, how presentation affects decision quality,
      and how to design systems that support reasoning rather than overwhelm it.
    </p>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>
      The final high-fidelity prototype provided structured guidance
      through treatment tradeoffs and laid groundwork for continued
      clinical implementation and iPad-based testing.
