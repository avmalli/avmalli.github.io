    <h1>Biosensors</h1>
    <p class="subhead">
      Interdisciplinary research using trained detection dogs and analytical chemistry methods to characterize
      volatile signatures of disease and develop scalable diagnostic tools.

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        One major aspect of my research examines the use of volatile organic compound (VOC) biosensors for noninvasive
        detection and diagnostics. Due to their trainability and olfaction capabilities (detection thresholds at parts
        per trillion), dogs serve as excellent biosensors for disease, infection, or physiological states.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rather than treating this solely as a behavioral phenomenon, I approach it as a systems problem: how can we
        rigorously characterize, validate, and translate these detection capabilities?
      </p>

      <p style="margin:0;">
        This work integrates behavioral experimentation, statistical modeling, and analytical chemistry to better understand
        odor signatures and their potential diagnostic value.
      </p>

      <h2>Canine detection as a biological sensor</h2>

      <p>
        Across multiple disease contexts, including chronic wasting disease (CWD) and other medical detection applications,
        I have evaluated whether trained detection dogs can reliably differentiate disease-positive from disease-negative
        biological samples under controlled and field conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In practice, each dog functions like a trainable classifier: we provide a well-selected training set of samples,
        and dogs learn and generalize VOC patterns that differentiate positive and negative states.
      </p>

      <p>
        The core challenge is generalization: can a learned odor category extend across variation in geography, storage conditions,
        individual differences, and environmental context?
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:10px;">To address this, I design studies that:</p>

      <ul style="margin:0; padding-left:18px;">
        <li>Systematically vary sample source and handling conditions</li>
        <li>Quantify sensitivity, specificity, and false positive rates</li>
        <li>Evaluate robustness in simulated field environments</li>
        <li>Model performance using mixed-effects statistical frameworks</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:0;">
        This allows us to leverage canine detection performance to inform and improve noninvasive diagnostic approaches.

      <h2>Integrating GC methods &amp; chemical analysis</h2>

      <p>
        In parallel with behavioral detection studies, I collaborate with analytical chemistry groups using gas chromatography (GC)
        and related methods to characterize VOC profiles in biological samples.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:10px;">
        The goal is not to position dogs and GC methods as competing approaches, but to use them comparatively and complementarily:
      </p>

      <ul style="margin:0; padding-left:18px;">
        <li>Do dogs respond to chemical features identifiable in GC spectra?</li>
        <li>Can the combination of canine detection and analytic chemistry help explain detection failures or variability?</li>
        <li>Can canine detection highlight patterns not easily isolated by instrumentation alone?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By comparing behavioral detection patterns with chemical feature data, we refine hypotheses about which volatile signatures are
        diagnostic and how they can be operationalized in scalable testing pipelines.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
        For example, dogs outperformed chemical analysis in classifying sweat samples positive for COVID-19 when the algorithm
        misclassified samples in the presence of pet hair. Dogs can provide useful benchmark performance for both chemosensors and
        chemical classification pipelines.

      <h2>Translational impact</h2>

      <p>
        This interdisciplinary approach has implications for wildlife disease surveillance, medical screening, and early diagnostic development.
        Dogs provide a flexible, mobile biosensing platform. Analytical chemistry provides molecular resolution. Together, they create an iterative
        framework for identifying, validating, and eventually automating disease-relevant signals.
      </p>

      <p style="margin:0;">
        More broadly, this work reflects a central question that runs throughout my research: how do we extract meaningful, reliable signal from
        complex biological data, and translate that into tools deployable outside of controlled laboratory environments?
