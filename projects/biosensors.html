      <h1>Biosensors & Translational Detection Systems</h1>
      <p>
        Interdisciplinary research using trained detection dogs and analytical chemistry methods to characterize volatile signatures of disease and develop scalable diagnostic tools.

      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        A major thread of my research examines biological detection systems as functional biosensors. Trained dogs are capable of detecting subtle volatile organic compound (VOC) patterns associated with disease, infection, or physiological state. Rather than treating this solely as an interesting behavioral phenomenon, I approach it as a systems problem: how can we rigorously characterize, validate, and translate these detection capabilities?
      </p>

      <p>
        This work integrates behavioral experimentation, statistical modeling, and analytical chemistry to better understand odor signatures and their potential diagnostic value.

      <h2>Canine Detection as a Biological Sensor</h2>

      <p>
        Across multiple disease contexts, including chronic wasting disease (CWD) and other medical detection applications, I have evaluated whether trained detection dogs can reliably differentiate disease-positive from disease-negative biological samples under controlled and field conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Importantly, the core question is not simply whether dogs can discriminate samples in a lab setting. The key challenge is generalization: can a learned odor category extend across variation in geography, storage conditions, individual differences, and environmental context?
      </p>

      <p>
        To address this, I design studies that:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Systematically vary sample source and handling conditions</li>
        <li>Quantify sensitivity, specificity, and false positive rates</li>
        <li>Evaluate robustness in simulated field environments</li>
        <li>Model performance using mixed-effects statistical frameworks</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This allows us to treat canine detection performance as measurable, testable system behavior rather than anecdote.
      </p>

      <h2>Integrating GC Methods & Chemical Analysis</h2>

      <p>
        In parallel with behavioral detection studies, I collaborate with analytical chemistry groups using gas chromatography (GC) and related methods to characterize volatile organic compound profiles in biological samples.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is not to position dogs and GC methods as competing approaches, but to use them comparatively and complementarily:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Do dogs respond to chemical features identifiable in GC spectra?</li>
        <li>Can chemical analysis help explain detection failures or variability?</li>
        <li>Can canine detection highlight signal structure not easily isolated by instrumentation alone?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By comparing behavioral detection patterns with chemical feature data, we aim to refine hypotheses about which volatile signatures are diagnostic and how they can be operationalized in scalable testing pipelines.
      </p>

      <h2>Translational Impact</h2>

      <p>
        This interdisciplinary approach has implications for wildlife disease surveillance, medical screening, and early diagnostic development. Dogs provide a flexible, mobile biosensing platform. Analytical chemistry provides molecular resolution. Together, they create an iterative framework for identifying, validating, and eventually automating disease-relevant signals.
      </p>

      <p>
        More broadly, this work reflects a central question that runs throughout my research: how do we extract meaningful, reliable signal from complex biological data — and translate that into tools that are deployable outside of controlled laboratory environments?
